 *    is computed on every sale" and parent_id can't encode that (a
 *    Director may literally have been created by IT rather than by GC).
 *
 *  - Per person, `earns_commission`. Lets one holder stop earning while
 *    keeping their role and access. Worth knowing for a 'chain' role:
 *    excluding the only holder of a tier doesn't delete that tier's
 *    share — the gap flows up to the next tier above them.
 *
 * The seller is always excluded by id: runCommissionPayout already puts
