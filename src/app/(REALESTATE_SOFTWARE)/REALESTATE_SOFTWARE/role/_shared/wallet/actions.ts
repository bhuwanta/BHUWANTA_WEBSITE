 * and it's what makes the hierarchy rule automatic rather than
 * something bolted on: a payout row only exists for the seller
 * themselves plus their own real upline chain (payout-engine.ts never
 * creates a row for anyone in the seller's downline). So if an RM sells
 * directly, no payout row is ever created for that RM's LIO/LIA at all
 * — there's nothing to filter, they were never eligible for a row on
 * that sale in the first place. A bottom-tier caller can never see an
 * upline's cut through this action, on this sale or any other, because
 * their own id never matches an upline's payee_id.
 *
 * IT is excluded entirely (isCommissionEligible('it') === false, IT is
 * never a payee) and Customer likewise isn't part of the commission
 * chain — this action simply returns nothing useful for either.
