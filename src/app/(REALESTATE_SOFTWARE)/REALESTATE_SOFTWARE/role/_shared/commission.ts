// Commission payout calculation for REALESTATE_SOFTWARE.
//
// Implements ../Doubts/HIERARCHY.md §3b (tiered percentage-difference
// model — supersedes an earlier "waterfall / cascading remainder" draft
// that is NOT what's implemented here). Pure functions, no I/O — callers
// are responsible for loading the seller's actual upline chain (via
// s_realestate_users.parent_id) and the current commission rates before
// calling this.
//
// Rounding policy (explicit product decision, not a default): every
// payout line is rounded UP to the next whole rupee — never left
// fractional, never rounded down against the payee. The exact
// pre-rounding figure is always kept alongside it (CommissionLine.rawAmount)
// so nothing is silently lost — see amount's doc comment below.
//
// All intermediate math is done in *integer paise*, not floating-point
// rupees. Multiplying two already-fractional JS numbers (e.g.
// 146.23 sq.yd × ₹8,000.55) can produce binary floating-point noise like
// 1169910.4265000001 — indistinguishable from a real fraction of a
// paisa unless you're careful. Scaling everything to integers before
// multiplying/dividing and only converting back to rupees at the very
// end avoids that whole class of bug (this codebase already hit one
// version of it once — a raw `pool * (pct/100)` landing on
// 14000.000000000002 instead of 14000 — this is the more rigorous fix,
// not just a cleanup pass after the fact).

 * §3b: given a seller and their real upline chain (ordered from the

 * or a shorter chain if some tiers were skipped when profiles were
 * created, per §2's "not just the next level down" rule), compute each
 * person's payout on a sale.
 *
 * - The seller gets their own full tier percentage of the pool.
 * - Everyone above gets the difference between their percentage and the
 *   percentage of whoever is immediately below them in this specific
 *   chain — applied to the SAME pool, not a shrinking remainder.
 * - With at most one person per tier this telescopes at the rawAmount
 *   level: raw amounts sum to exactly the highest participating tier's
 *   percentage of the pool. Once each line is independently rounded UP
 *   to the next rupee (product decision — see file header), the *paid*
 *   total can exceed that exact figure by up to ~₹1 per line (worst
 *   case ~₹8-9 across a full 9-tier chain) — an accepted, intentional
 *   cost of always rounding in the payee's favor, not a bug.
 * - It deliberately stops telescoping when a tier is held by SEVERAL
 *   active people (e.g. three active CEOs): each of them earns that
 *   tier's full marginal percentage, so the total exceeds the top
 *   tier's percentage by one extra tier-share per additional holder
 *   (three CEOs on a 28% chain pay out 32%, not 28%). That is the
 *   intended rule, not double-payment — see the same-tier handling in
 *   the loop below and the CEO/GC fan-out in downline.ts.
 * - `pool` is `plot_size_sqyd × base_price_at_submission` (§3b/§3d) —
 *   NOT the MRP/customer-facing amount. Use computePool() above to get
 *   this precisely rather than a plain `*`.
 *
 * A role missing from `rates` (e.g. `it` should never appear in a chain
 * at all — it's not commission-eligible, see isCommissionEligible in
 * permissions.ts) is skipped rather than throwing, so a caller that
 * accidentally includes a non-eligible role doesn't corrupt the rest of
 * the breakdown.
