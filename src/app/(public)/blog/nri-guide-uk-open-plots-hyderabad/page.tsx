  {
    question: 'Can a UK NRI buy open plots in India without visiting?',
    answer: 'Yes. Buying remotely is common for UK-based NRIs. You can complete due diligence, sign documents, and register the sale through a Power of Attorney (PoA) holder in India, without traveling — as long as your PoA is properly notarised and apostilled in the UK first.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need an Indian bank account to buy property from the UK?',
    answer: 'Yes. Property payments from an NRI must route through an NRE, NRO, or FCNR account — not a UK bank account paying a seller directly. Most UK-based buyers open an NRE account to fund the purchase, since NRE accounts are held in Indian Rupees and are fully repatriable.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a UK Power of Attorney valid for Indian property registration?',
    answer: 'Yes, provided it is executed correctly: signed in wet ink before a UK Notary Public, then apostilled by the UK FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office). Because India and the UK are both parties to the Hague Apostille Convention, an FCDO-apostilled PoA is accepted directly in India without further attestation at the Indian High Commission. If the PoA covers a property transaction, it also needs to be registered at the Sub-Registrar\'s office in India, with applicable stamp duty paid.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is rental income from Indian property taxed in the UK?',
    answer: 'Rental income from an Indian property is taxable in India first. As a UK resident, you also report worldwide income to HMRC, including Indian rental income, on your Self Assessment return — but the India-UK Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) lets you claim a Foreign Tax Credit for the Indian tax already paid, so you are not taxed twice on the same income. Exact rates and thresholds change with each budget cycle in both countries, so confirm current figures with a UK tax advisor familiar with NRI/foreign income.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between NRE and NRO accounts for a UK buyer?',
    answer: 'An NRE account holds money you bring in from the UK (e.g. your purchase funds) in Indian Rupees, and is fully repatriable — principal and interest can move back to the UK without restriction, and NRE interest is exempt from Indian income tax. An NRO account is for income earned within India, such as rent from your plot once developed, is subject to Indian income tax, and has RBI-set annual repatriation limits. Most UK buyers use NRE to fund the purchase and NRO to receive any India-sourced income afterward.',

      <p>
        UK-based NRIs buying land near Hyderabad face a genuinely different process than US or UAE buyers — a
        different tax authority (HMRC, not the IRS), a different double-taxation treaty, and a Power of Attorney
        route that runs through a UK Notary Public and the FCDO, not a consulate. This guide walks through what
        actually applies if you&apos;re buying from London, Birmingham, Manchester, or anywhere else in the UK.
      </p>

      <h2>Can UK NRIs Buy Plots in India?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, NRIs can purchase residential and commercial
        property in India — including open plots — without RBI approval and without any limit on the number of
        properties. The one category that&apos;s off-limits is agricultural land, plantation property, or a
        farmhouse; those can generally only come to an NRI through inheritance, not direct purchase. Open,
        HMDA/DTCP-approved residential plots, like the ones Bhuwanta develops, fall squarely in the permitted
        category.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Open Plots Near Hyderabad Make Sense for UK Buyers</h2>
      <p>
        This is the part worth getting excited about. Hyderabad&apos;s growth corridors — Shabad on the NH-44
        Bangalore Highway, the Warangal Highway near Yadagirigutta, Sangareddy on the Mumbai Highway near the
        Regional Ring Road, and Sadashivpet — are still in an earlier, more affordable phase of development
        compared to established UK property markets. For a UK-based investor, that means access to
        legally-clear, government-approved land in a fast-growing market at a fraction of what equivalent capital
        would buy in residential UK property. This is the section to be confident in, not hedge on — the
        opportunity is real, and it&apos;s backed by verifiable approvals, not projections.
      </p>

      <h2>UK-Specific Tax Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Any rental income you eventually earn from Indian property needs to be reported to HMRC on the foreign
        income pages of your Self Assessment return, alongside being taxed in India first. The India-UK Double
        Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) exists specifically so you don&apos;t get taxed twice on the same
        income — you claim a Foreign Tax Credit in the UK for tax already paid in India. Capital gains on a future
        sale work the same way: taxable in India first, then reportable in the UK with a credit for Indian tax
        paid. We&apos;re deliberately not quoting specific rates or thresholds here, because both the UK and
        Indian tax authorities revise these on their own budget cycles — get current numbers from a UK tax advisor
        who handles NRI/foreign income before you file anything.
      </p>

      <h2>The UK Power of Attorney Process</h2>
      <p>
        This is the step that confuses UK buyers most, so it&apos;s worth doing properly. Unlike some other
        countries, a Power of Attorney for use in India from the UK is <strong>not</strong> attested through the
        Indian High Commission. Instead:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sign the PoA in wet ink in person before a UK Notary Public.</li>
        <li>
          Have the notarised document apostilled by the UK FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office).
          Because India and the UK are both parties to the Hague Apostille Convention, this apostille is accepted
          directly in India — no separate Indian High Commission attestation is needed on top of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your representative in India uses the apostilled PoA to act on your behalf. If it covers a property
          transaction, it also needs to be registered at the Sub-Registrar&apos;s office in India, with stamp duty
          paid (rates vary by state).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Processing and fees for the FCDO apostille step can change, so confirm current turnaround times and cost
        directly with the FCDO or your notary before you plan around a specific timeline.
      </p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Buying Process</h2>
      <p>Once the legal groundwork is clear, the practical steps are straightforward:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Documents:</strong> passport, current UK visa or Biometric Residence Permit (BRP), PAN card
          (Permanent Account Number — apply in advance if you don&apos;t have one), and UK address proof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bank account:</strong> open an NRE account to fund the purchase in Indian Rupees — this keeps
          the funds fully repatriable later. An NRO account is used separately for any India-sourced income, such
          as rent, once you own the plot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Due diligence remotely:</strong> request the approval documents (HMDA/DTCP), RERA certificate,
          and layout plan directly from the seller, and verify them against the relevant government portals —
          don&apos;t rely on a brochure or a verbal claim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registration:</strong> your PoA holder in India completes the registration at the local
          Sub-Registrar&apos;s office once payment and documentation are in order.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why HMDA/DTCP/RERA Approval Matters</h2>
      <p>
        For a buyer managing a purchase from thousands of miles away, title risk is the single biggest fear — and
        it&apos;s a legitimate one. This is where we can speak with full confidence about our own projects, not
        just the market in general: every Bhuwanta project is HMDA, DTCP, or YTDA approved and RERA registered,
        and we make the approval documents and RERA certificates available on request. We&apos;d rather a UK buyer
        verify everything independently — through the government portals, or through their own lawyer — than take
        our word for it. That verification is exactly what removes the remote-buying risk.
