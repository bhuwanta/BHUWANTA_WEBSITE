      <h2>Quick Definitions: What DTCP and HMDA Actually Approve</h2>
      <p>
        HMDA (Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority) approves layouts within the Hyderabad metropolitan
        region, applying stricter infrastructure standards. DTCP (Directorate of Town and Country Planning) approves
        layouts outside HMDA&apos;s jurisdiction, typically in emerging corridors further from the city. Both are
        legally valid, government-issued approvals, and both are bank-loan eligible when the layout is also RERA
        registered. For the full side-by-side comparison — pricing profile, infrastructure standards, and
        appreciation pattern — see our dedicated{' '}
        <Link href="/hmda-vs-dtcp-plots-hyderabad">HMDA vs DTCP Approved Plots in Hyderabad</Link> guide.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Applies Where in the Shadnagar / Shabad Belt</h2>
      <p>
        Shadnagar and the surrounding NH-44 corridor — including neighboring Shabad — is a mixed belt: some layouts
        fall under DTCP, others under HMDA, depending on the specific parcel&apos;s location relative to the HMDA
        boundary. There is no single blanket answer for &quot;is Shadnagar HMDA or DTCP&quot; — it depends on the exact
        layout. This is exactly why buyers in this belt need to verify approval type per-project rather than
        assuming based on the town name.
      </p>

      <h2>Document Checklist for Verifying Either Approval Type</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Request the layout&apos;s HMDA or DTCP approval number and verify it against the relevant government portal.</li>
        <li>Confirm RERA registration and check its live status on the Telangana RERA portal.</li>
        <li>Review the approved layout plan against the actual plot boundaries being offered.</li>
        <li>Request an Encumbrance Certificate to confirm clear, dispute-free title.</li>
        <li>For DTCP layouts specifically, confirm what infrastructure (roads, drainage) the developer is contractually committing to versus what already exists.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Bhuwanta Fits</h2>
      <p>
        Bhuwanta doesn&apos;t currently have inventory in Shadnagar itself. Our nearest live, verified project on this
        corridor is <Link href="/projects/vian-vally">Vian Vally</Link>, in neighboring Shabad — HMDA approved and
        RERA registered, on the same NH-44 highway corridor. If you&apos;re specifically evaluating Shadnagar, see our{' '}
        <Link href="/blog/open-plots-shadnagar-growth-story-2026">Shadnagar growth story guide</Link>{' '}
        alongside this one before deciding.
