const steps = [
  {
    title: '1. Verify the HMDA or DTCP Approval Number',
    body: 'Every legitimate layout has a specific approval number issued by either the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) or the Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP). Ask the seller for this number directly and cross-check it against the relevant government portal — never accept a verbal assurance that "the area is approved."',
  },
  {
    title: '2. Confirm RERA Registration',
    body: 'Under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, most residential land projects in Telangana must be registered with Telangana RERA (TS-RERA). Ask for the RERA registration number and verify its status directly on the official TS-RERA portal — not just a certificate photo, which can be outdated or altered.',
  },
  {
    title: '3. Request the Approved Layout Plan',
    body: 'Marketing brochures and renders are not the same as the government-approved layout plan filed with HMDA/DTCP. Ask to see the actual approved plan and confirm the specific plot number and boundaries you\'re being offered match it exactly.',
  },
  {
    title: '4. Obtain an Encumbrance Certificate (EC)',
    body: 'An EC confirms the land is free of legal disputes, unpaid loans, or competing claims for a specified period. Insist on reviewing a recent EC (ideally covering 13-30 years) before making any payment.',
  },
  {
    title: '5. Check the Title Deed Chain',
    body: 'Trace the ownership history (the "link documents") back several transactions to confirm a clear, unbroken chain of title. A lawyer can do this verification for a modest fee — it is money well spent before a land purchase.',
  },
  {
    title: '6. Verify Land Use Classification',
    body: 'Confirm the land is classified for the use you intend (residential open plot) and not agricultural land that hasn\'t been legally converted — buying unconverted agricultural land for residential use carries real legal risk.',
  },
  {
    title: '7. Check for Pending Litigation',
    body: 'Ask whether the land or the developer is currently involved in any civil litigation. A local property lawyer can do a basic litigation search at the relevant court/sub-registrar records.',
  },
  {
    title: '8. Confirm Registration & Stamp Duty Process',
    body: 'Understand the registration process, applicable stamp duty, and registration charges before booking — a transparent developer will walk you through this clearly, not gloss over it.',
  },
